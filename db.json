The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys\". The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.\r\nMellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little. \r\nWell-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":400,"titles":{"en":"Cowboy Bebop","en_jp":"Cowboy Bebop","ja_jp":"カウボーイビバップ"},"canonicalTitle":"Cowboy Bebop","abbreviatedTitles":["COWBOY BEBOP"],"averageRating":"82.5","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"3370","3":"53","4":"399","5":"29","6":"165","7":"32","8":"3188","9":"36","10":"641","11":"55","12":"2136","13":"119","14":"6729","15":"292","16":"7114","17":"573","18":"8641","19":"540","20":"30501"},"userCount":111813,"favoritesCount":4453,"startDate":"1998-04-03","endDate":"1999-04-24","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":26,"ratingRank":77,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1/tiny.jpg?1431697256","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1/small.jpg?1431697256","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1/medium.jpg?1431697256","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1/large.jpg?1431697256","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/1/original.jpg?1431697256","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/1/tiny.jpg?1519178801","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/1/small.jpg?1519178801","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/1/large.jpg?1519178801","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/1/original.jpg?1519178801","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":26,"episodeLength":25,"totalLength":626,"youtubeVideoId":"qig4KOK2R2g","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/1/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"2","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/2"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:16.085Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T15:02:52.110Z","slug":"cowboy-bebop-tengoku-no-tobira","synopsis":"Another day, another bounty—such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop.

Despite being pressured by his superiors to perform surgery on the mayor, his morals force him to perform the surgery on the other critical patient, saving his life and forfeiting the mayor's. A doctor is taught to believe that all life is equal; however, when a series of murders occur in the surgeon's vicinity, all of the evidence pointing to the boy he saved, Kenzou's beliefs are shaken. Along his journey to unravel the true identity of his little patient, Kenzou discovers that the fate of the world may be intertwined with the mysterious child.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":200,"titles":{"en":"Monster","en_jp":"Monster","ja_jp":"モンスター"},"canonicalTitle":"Monster","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"82.32","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"694","3":"10","4":"131","5":"9","6":"74","7":"7","8":"606","9":"4","10":"189","11":"19","12":"750","13":"12","14":"1380","15":"80","16":"2235","17":"131","18":"2918","19":"141","20":"6422"},"userCount":41739,"favoritesCount":1543,"startDate":"2004-04-07","endDate":"2005-09-28","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":173,"ratingRank":196,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Mild Nudity","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10/tiny.jpg?1495114402","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10/small.jpg?1495114402","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10/medium.jpg?1495114402","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10/large.jpg?1495114402","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/10/original.jpg?1495114402","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/10/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":74,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1776,"youtubeVideoId":"9aS-EgdAq6U","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/10/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"11","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/11"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:24.797Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T15:02:52.783Z","slug":"naruto","synopsis":"Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc.

In the 1920’s, monstrous demons began appearing in surprisingly high numbers across America, manifesting as sin incarnate. To combat this menace, a holy organization known as the Order of Magdalene established branches across the country, all governed by the Council of the Catholic Church.\r\nThe New York branch is home to the young and reckless Sister Rosette Christopher and her demon hunting partner, Chrno. Armed to the teeth with holy guns and bullets, the two are renowned for accomplishing their job, but also causing extensive property damage at the same time. This doesn’t exactly please the head of their branch, Sister Kate Valentine, though Rosette is still greatly appreciated by the branch’s minister, Father Ewan Remington, and their weapon developer, Edward Hamilton.\r\nChrno, however, leaves them with a sense of unease; there’s more to him than there appears to be, and even more behind the bond that he and Rosette share. Placing their lives in each other’s hands, the two of them must continue to fight off the increasingly mounting demonic menace, discover its source, and hopefully complete Rosette’s own personal mission of finding her missing brother, Joshua.","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Chrono Crusade","en_jp":"Chrno Crusade","en_us":"Chrono Crusade","ja_jp":"クロノクルセイド"},"canonicalTitle":"Chrno Crusade","abbreviatedTitles":["Chrno Crusade: Mary Magdalene"],"averageRating":"75.36","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"36","3":"0","4":"42","5":"2","6":"54","7":"1","8":"162","9":"2","10":"312","11":"9","12":"751","13":"13","14":"1218","15":"20","16":"1375","17":"15","18":"606","19":"2","20":"914"},"userCount":12918,"favoritesCount":113,"startDate":"2003-11-25","endDate":"2004-06-10","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":816,"ratingRank":1578,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/41/tiny.jpg?1408440548","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/41/small.jpg?1408440548","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/41/medium.jpg?1408440548","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/41/large.jpg?1408440548","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/41/original.jpg?1408440548","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/41/tiny.jpg?1519179009","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/41/small.jpg?1519179009","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/41/large.jpg?1519179009","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/41/original.jpg?1519179009","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":24,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":552,"youtubeVideoId":"BRLC0zVfjL0","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/41/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"42","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/42"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:53.867Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T15:02:54.741Z","slug":"d-n-angel","synopsis":"Daisuke Niwa is a clumsy, block-headed, and wimpy middle school student who has few redeeming qualities.

Upon being named Ren, she imprints upon him as her \"Master\" and serves as his personal \"Slave,\" leaving him with a \"DearS\" who wants to remain with him no matter what and bringing his ordinary, alien-free days to an end.","coverImageTopOffset":130,"titles":{"en":"DearS","en_jp":"DearS","en_us":"DearS","ja_jp":"ディアーズ"},"canonicalTitle":"DearS","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"64.05","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"105","3":"1","4":"161","5":"4","6":"194","7":"1","8":"372","9":"4","10":"540","11":"12","12":"969","13":"9","14":"941","15":"13","16":"749","17":"2","18":"219","19":"2","20":"340"},"userCount":9173,"favoritesCount":22,"startDate":"2004-07-11","endDate":"2004-09-26","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":1150,"ratingRank":7214,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Mild Nudity","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/44/tiny.jpg?1417748144","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/44/small.jpg?1417748144","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/44/medium.jpg?1417748144","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/44/large.jpg?1417748144","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/44/original.jpg?1417748144","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/44/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/44/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/44/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/44/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":276,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/44/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"45","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/45"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:00:56.582Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"rozen-maiden","synopsis":"Sakurada Jun spends his days online, ordering whatever he takes a liking to, only to return it before the payment is due.

Accompanying Chiyo are students like Tomo Takino, an energetic tomboy with more enthusiasm than brains; Koyomi Mizuhara, Tomo's best friend whose temper has a fuse shorter than Chiyo; and Sakaki, a tall, athletic beauty whose intimidating looks hide a gentle personality and a painful obsession with cats.

When Kamille steals a Titan's prototype Gundam, he soon finds himself in the middle of the dangerous conflict.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":110,"titles":{"en":"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam","en_jp":"Kidou Senshi Zeta Gundam","en_us":"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam","ja_jp":"機動戦士Ζガンダム"},"canonicalTitle":"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam","abbreviatedTitles":["Mobile Suit Z Gundam"],"averageRating":"78.77","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"31","3":"0","4":"12","5":"0","6":"21","7":"1","8":"54","9":"3","10":"80","11":"2","12":"222","13":"5","14":"439","15":"28","16":"653","17":"21","18":"383","19":"13","20":"526"},"userCount":5321,"favoritesCount":183,"startDate":"1985-03-02","endDate":"1986-02-22","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":1810,"ratingRank":780,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/64/tiny.jpg?1426773499","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/64/small.jpg?1426773499","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/64/medium.jpg?1426773499","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/64/large.jpg?1426773499","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/64/original.jpg?1426773499","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":50,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1200,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"65","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/65"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:15.257Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T15:02:56.608Z","slug":"mobile-suit-gundam-zz","synopsis":"The year is Universal Century 0088.

However, when they take on a high-rated delivery to bring an orphan girl named Alvis Hamilton to the battleship Silvana, they get dragged into a much greater conflict that pits them against the might of the Guild.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":250,"titles":{"en":"Last Exile","en_jp":"Last Exile","ja_jp":"ラストエグザイル"},"canonicalTitle":"Last Exile","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"78.78","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"28","3":"0","4":"30","5":"3","6":"20","7":"1","8":"111","9":"1","10":"183","11":"5","12":"510","13":"16","14":"942","15":"21","16":"1423","17":"21","18":"694","19":"8","20":"1072"},"userCount":13076,"favoritesCount":204,"startDate":"2003-04-08","endDate":"2003-09-30","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":798,"ratingRank":776,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/tiny.jpg?1433415228","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/small.jpg?1433415228","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/medium.jpg?1433415228","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/large.jpg?1433415228","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/original.png?1433415228","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":26,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":624,"youtubeVideoId":"sG95d8TQomA","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"77","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/77"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:27.162Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"mai-hime","synopsis":"Thirteen girls, each with the ability to materialize \"Elements\" and summon metallic guardians called \"Childs\" have been brought to Fuuka Academy to battle mysterious creatures called Orphans.

However, when she met a soldier named Ryuuya, she fell in love with him and told him of her wishes to see the outside world and to find her mother. Ryuuya attempted to fulfill these wishes. However, his efforts were in vain as Kanna was sealed in the sky through magic and cursed to be in pain for all eternity.\r\nHundreds of years later, Yukito, a decendant of Ryuuya, comes to a quiet town one week before their annual festival with hopes that he can make some money. However, when he meets an unusual girl called Misuzu, he is reminded of what his mother once told him—\"When you go out on your journey, if you find the winged girl's re-incarnation, you must use your power to set her free.\"\r\nYukito and Misuzu's fates soon become intertwined with each other, with each developing feelings for the other. However when Yukito realizes Misuzu's connection to the past, he must decide on whether to leave, or to attempt to break the curse that has bound Kanna in centuries of pain.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":75,"titles":{"en":"Air: The Motion Picture","en_jp":"Air Movie","ja_jp":"劇場版AIR"},"canonicalTitle":"Air Movie","abbreviatedTitles":["Gekijouban Air"],"averageRating":"69.46","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"29","3":"0","4":"52","5":"0","6":"60","7":"2","8":"163","9":"1","10":"198","11":"2","12":"442","13":"6","14":"555","15":"6","16":"465","17":"2","18":"204","19":"0","20":"277"},"userCount":4231,"favoritesCount":6,"startDate":"2005-02-05","endDate":"2005-02-05","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":2111,"ratingRank":4221,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"movie","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/tiny.jpg?1408440656","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/small.jpg?1408440656","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/medium.jpg?1408440656","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/large.jpg?1408440656","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/original.png?1408440656","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":1,"episodeLength":91,"totalLength":91,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"movie","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"81","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/81"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:31.001Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T15:04:09.681Z","slug":"aishiteruze-baby","synopsis":"Katakura Kippei is in every way a high school playboy.

Living with her guardian in a cottage on Mochi-mochi mountain is Seravi, who is her teacher and also the fictional world's greatest magician. Chacha is clumsy in casting her spells because, throughout the anime, when she summons something, it often turns out to be something that she didn't mean to cast, for example, spiders (kumo) instead of a cloud (also kumo). At times in the anime when she and her friends are in trouble, however, her spells do work. Living on the same mountain is a boy gifted with enormous strength named Riiya. It is described that Riiya came from a family of werewolves who can instantly change into a wolf whenever they want. Quite far from Mochi-mochi mountain lies Urizuri mountain. Dorothy, also a well known magician in her land, lives in a castle on Urizuri mountain. Living with her is Shiine, her student. Shiine is adept when it comes to casting spells. He is a young wizard and most of his knowledge about magic was taught to him by Dorothy.\r\nThe first 2 seasons were originally created by the anime team. Most of the stories in season 3 are based on the manga.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)","coverImageTopOffset":200,"titles":{"en":"Red Riding Hood Chacha","en_jp":"Akazukin Chacha","ja_jp":"赤ずきんチャチャ"},"canonicalTitle":"Akazukin Chacha","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"69.4","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"3","3":"0","4":"0","5":"0","6":"2","7":"0","8":"10","9":"0","10":"26","11":"1","12":"197","13":"2","14":"94","15":"1","16":"53","17":"0","18":"21","19":"0","20":"41"},"userCount":1033,"favoritesCount":7,"startDate":"1994-01-07","endDate":"1995-06-30","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":4491,"ratingRank":4248,"ageRating":"G","ageRatingGuide":"All Ages","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/82/tiny.jpg?1408440660","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/82/small.jpg?1408440660","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/82/medium.jpg?1408440660","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/82/large.jpg?1408440660","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/82/original.jpg?1408440660","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/82/small.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/82/small.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/82/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/82/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"episodeCount":74,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1776,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/82/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"83","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/83"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:33.002Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"ayashi-no-ceres","synopsis":"Ceres was a tennyo (Celestial maiden) who came down from the heavens to bathe in a stream.

It is also during a fictitious era called \"The Era of the Cooking Wars\". It was an era in which top chefs with different cooking styles tried their best to improve their skills and to become the best chef in China. It is a country where insulting a high-grade chef or fooling around with cooking could land a person in a jail, and impersonating a top-chef is as good as usurpation of authority. Chefs compete with each other in order to gain respect and even power, but also with the risks of losing everything.\r\nThe country of China has four major regions: Beijing, Szechuan, Shanghai, and Guangdong.\r\nThe beginning of the story takes place in Szechuan, Mao's birthplace.\r\nAfter the death of Mao's mother, Pai, who was called the 'Fairy of Cuisine', Mao becomes a Super Chef in order to take the title as Master Chef of his mother's restaurant. However, before he takes his mother's place as Master Chef, he continues to travel China in order to learn more of the many ways of cooking, in the hopes of becoming a legendary chef, just like his mother.

Due to increasingly low birth rates in Japan, the Japanese government is testing a program in which two young people are forced to marry. Ryo wants no part of it, but he is given little choice in the matter; his new fiancée, Shizuka, comes to his home late one night with several dozen government issued bodyguards, who are there to ensure the success of the new couple.

With his supreme alchemy skills, Edward binds Alphonse's soul to a large suit of armor.\r\nA year later, Edward, now promoted to the fullmetal alchemist of the state, embarks on a journey with his younger brother to obtain the Philosopher's Stone. The fabled mythical object is rumored to be capable of amplifying an alchemist's abilities by leaps and bounds, thus allowing them to override the fundamental law of alchemy: to gain something, an alchemist must sacrifice something of equal value. Edward hopes to draw into the military's resources to find the fabled stone and restore his and Alphonse's bodies to normal. However, the Elric brothers soon discover that there is more to the legendary stone than meets the eye, as they are led to the epicenter of a far darker battle than they could have ever imagined.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL)","coverImageTopOffset":70,"titles":{"en":"Fullmetal Alchemist","en_jp":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi","ja_jp":"鋼の錬金術師"},"canonicalTitle":"Fullmetal Alchemist","abbreviatedTitles":["FMA","Full Metal Alchemist","Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)","HagaRen"],"averageRating":"82.51","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"1553","3":"29","4":"178","5":"20","6":"141","7":"42","8":"2516","9":"49","10":"882","11":"73","12":"2680","13":"191","14":"11213","15":"463","16":"10209","17":"691","18":"7740","19":"376","20":"25914"},"userCount":104778,"favoritesCount":2020,"startDate":"2003-10-04","endDate":"2004-10-02","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":31,"ratingRank":74,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/tiny.jpg?1432381072","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/small.jpg?1432381072","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/medium.jpg?1432381072","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/large.jpg?1432381072","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/original.jpg?1432381072","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/tiny.jpg?1519179240","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/small.jpg?1519179240","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/large.jpg?1519179240","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/original.jpg?1519179240","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":51,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1224,"youtubeVideoId":"NR5HHcLPulc","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"101","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/101"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:51.293Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"full-moon-wo-sagashite","synopsis":"12-year-old Mitsuki Kouyama's dream to become a professional singer is shattered when she's diagnosed with throat cancer.

great war occurred in the 20th century between humans and monsters. Since that time, the monsters rule the world in fear but keep relatively hidden from public view. A boy named Bokka ponders the past and wonders what became of the Meros Warriors who defended the world so bravely against the demons. He soon meets Kurofune and learns of the power of the Meros and the I-bar machines they ride in battle. Warriors are the only ones who can see and hear the Melody of Oblivion, a phantom girl hidden away waiting to be rescued and be the savior of mankind. During a battle between Kurofune and a demon, Bokka discovers something only his wildest dreams could possibly imagine...he too can hear that melody. Throughout his journeys, Bokka meets many monsters and their agents, friends, and companions as he discovers the true extent of his new powers. He must continue to battle evil in the hope of releasing Boukyaku no Senritsu and free a world that has forgotten its once beautiful melody.\r\n(Source: ANN)","coverImageTopOffset":40,"titles":{"en":"The Melody of Oblivion","en_jp":"Boukyaku no Senritsu","en_us":"The Melody of Oblivion","ja_jp":"忘却の旋律"},"canonicalTitle":"Boukyaku no Senritsu","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"63.05","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"13","3":"0","4":"20","5":"0","6":"27","7":"0","8":"42","9":"0","10":"64","11":"2","12":"98","13":"0","14":"96","15":"1","16":"52","17":"0","18":"34","19":"0","20":"26"},"userCount":1618,"favoritesCount":5,"startDate":"2004-04-07","endDate":"2004-09-22","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":3672,"ratingRank":7623,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/137/tiny.jpg?1408440777","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/137/small.jpg?1408440777","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/137/medium.jpg?1408440777","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/137/large.jpg?1408440777","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/137/original.jpg?1408440777","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/137/tiny.jpg?1519179377","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/137/small.jpg?1519179377","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/137/large.jpg?1519179377","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/137/original.jpg?1519179377","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":24,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":552,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/137/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"138","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/138"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:02:26.062Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"now-and-then-here-and-there","synopsis":"Shu is a typical Japanese boy, but has an unbeatable, optimistic and determined attitude.

You can take new classes and make new friends. For Souichiro Nagi and Bob Makihara, though, high school means something different: the chance to become the top fighters in the entire student body! Too bad Toudou Academy is the hardest possible place to realize their dreams. Their new high school is no ordinary academic institution. Rather than concentrating on classic subjects like math and science, Toudou Academy was created for the sole purpose of reviving the martial arts in Japan!\r\nAs a result, Souichiro's aspirations to become top dog are cut short when he runs afoul of Masataka Takayanagi and Maya Natsume.

However, his bloodline consists of many great magicians throughout the ages, meaning that while he may not be a great magician, his offspring could be. This leads to him being sought after by three different young women: Yuna Miyama, a transfer student who declares herself his wife upon arrival, Rin Kamishiro, a prideful swordswoman of a traditional

That is, until she accidentally spills a drink all over one of her customers! With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.\r\nFor their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other.\r\nSet in an alternate Edo Period of Japan, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":375,"titles":{"en":"Samurai Champloo","en_jp":"Samurai

He has questions no one can answer fully, but follows a girl from a chance meeting in hopes to discover any. The girl, Yurika, is captain of the private battleship Nadesico, and in order to follow her, he enlists as their cook.

The resulting explosion, which came to be known as the Overdrive, destroyed a tenth of the world; fragments of the Rave were scattered throughout.Groove Adventure Rave takes place fifty years after the Overdrive. A group known as Demon Card has collected the remaining Dark Brings, using them to lay siege to a number of towns.

Not only are these students blessed with abilities that draw from the souls they are tied to, but they are also blessed, or maybe cursed, with the fates of these warriors from the past.\r\nOne of these students is Hakufu Sonsaku; a young, caring, dim-witted girl who has recently transferred into Nanyo Academy and will be living with her cousin, Koukin Shuyu. Hakufu’s arrival creates an almost immediate sense of tension due to her power as a fighter and the possibility that she may be the one who carries the spirit of the Chinese warlord, Sun Ce. The most powerful fighters at Nanyo, known as “The Big Four” are shaken by her presence and determined to stop Hakufu from achieving the goal given to her by her mother: to conquer those who challenge her and unite the seven schools.","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Ikki Tousen","en_jp":"Ikkitousen","ja_jp":"一騎当千"},"canonicalTitle":"Ikkitousen","abbreviatedTitles":["Ikki-Tosen: Legendary Fighter","Battle Vixens"],"averageRating":"60.72","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"133","3":"2","4":"195","5":"2","6":"188","7":"1","8":"374","9":"8","10":"482","11":"2","12":"785","13":"7","14":"804","15":"6","16":"412","17":"3","18":"162","19":"1","20":"235"},"userCount":8782,"favoritesCount":18,"startDate":"2003-07-30","endDate":"2003-10-22","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":1189,"ratingRank":8383,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"Mild Nudity","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/232/tiny.jpg?1408440991","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/232/small.jpg?1408440991","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/232/medium.jpg?1408440991","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/232/large.jpg?1408440991","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/232/original.jpg?1408440991","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/232/tiny.jpg?1519179747","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/232/small.jpg?1519179747","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/232/large.jpg?1519179747","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/232/original.jpg?1519179747","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":312,"youtubeVideoId":"Y2zvs5WtS_s","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/232/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"233","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/233"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:03:52.706Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"hitsuji-no-uta","synopsis":"Kazuna's family has a history of suffering from a disease that creates an uncontrollable vampire-like thirst for blood.

Alongside new recruit Seras Victoria, Alucard will find that a new threat has arisen, one greater than anything the Hellsing Organization has ever dealt with before.","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Hellsing","en_jp":"Hellsing","en_us":"Hellsing","ja_jp":"Hellsing [ヘルシング]"},"canonicalTitle":"Hellsing","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"73.64","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"91","3":"2","4":"133","5":"1","6":"209","7":"3","8":"732","9":"22","10":"897","11":"20","12":"2211","13":"56","14":"3337","15":"65","16":"2969","17":"48","18":"1468","19":"14","20":"2396"},"userCount":29607,"favoritesCount":270,"startDate":"2001-10-11","endDate":"2002-01-17","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":290,"ratingRank":2181,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/245/tiny.jpg?1408441027","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/245/small.jpg?1408441027","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/245/medium.jpg?1408441027","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/245/large.jpg?1408441027","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/245/original.jpg?1408441027","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/245/tiny.jpg?1519179846","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/245/small.jpg?1519179846","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/245/large.jpg?1519179846","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/245/original.jpg?1519179846","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":299,"youtubeVideoId":"A4ZVXuYYKWY","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/245/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"246","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/246"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:04:05.470Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"gad-guard","synopsis":"Several hundred years in the future, the resources of the Earth runs out, and the progression of the human race has stagnated.

the first day her family moved to their new house, 5-year-old Ami-chan made friends with three talking animals who came out of a door in her bedroom floor, which she finds out leads to Animal Yokocho, another world. The three are Issa, an overly innocent, soft-spoken panda, Kenta, a highly strung, red-scarf-loving bear who puts on an almost constant tough-guy act, and Iyo, a rabbit who usually holds her own well-being and enjoyment over the happiness (and safety) of her friends. Even at only 5 years old, Ami-chan is easily the most rational of the group, and she's a little wary at first, but she eventually comes around and starts spending her free time with them. A typical day involves Ami-chan and the three doing different things to pass the time, often playing a seemingly innocent game, but in AniYoko style. Unfortunately for Ami-chan, the AniYoko version usually turns out to be drastically different, much less logical, and usually more dangerous than the ordinary version.\n(Source: ANN)","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Animal Lane","en_jp":"Animal Yokochou","en_us":"Animal Lane","ja_jp":"アニマル横町"},"canonicalTitle":"Animal Yokochou","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"66.46","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"1","3":"0","4":"3","5":"0","6":"1","7":"0","8":"3","9":"0","10":"21","11":"0","12":"19","13":"0","14":"10","15":"0","16":"7","17":"0","18":"2","19":"0","20":"1"},"userCount":228,"favoritesCount":2,"startDate":"2005-10-04","endDate":"2006-09-26","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":8164,"ratingRank":5877,"ageRating":"G","ageRatingGuide":"All Ages","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/255/tiny.jpg?1408441051","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/255/small.jpg?1408441051","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/255/medium.jpg?1408441051","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/255/large.jpg?1408441051","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/255/original.jpg?1408441051","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":null,"episodeCount":51,"episodeLength":23,"totalLength":1173,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/255/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"256","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/256"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:04:15.707Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"akane-maniax","synopsis":"Jouji Gouda is a new transfer student at Hakuryo High.

Too bad her parents have other opinions on the subject.\r\nOne day, while Yukari is walking down the street, a guy with multiple piercings and bleached hair flags her down.

Advancements in science and technology have led to the colonization of the moon, the commercialization of outer space, and the formation of large space corporations. Ai Tanabe, an upbeat woman whose interests lie in the cosmos, joins Technora Corporation as a member of their Debris Section, a department dedicated to the removal of dangerous space junk between the orbits of the Earth and Moon.\r\nHowever, Ai soon discovers how unappreciated her job is. As the laughingstock of Technora, the Debris Section is severely understaffed, poorly funded, and is forced to use a dilapidated spaceship nicknamed the \"Toy Box\" for debris retrieval. Undeterred, Ai perseveres and gradually becomes acquainted with the strange personalities that make up the Debris Section's staff, such as the bumbling but good-natured chief clerk Philippe Myers; the mysterious and tight-lipped temp worker Edelgard Rivera; and the hotheaded and passionate Hachirota Hoshino, who longs for a spaceship to call his own.\r\nWinner of the Seiun Award in 2005, Planetes is an unconventional sci-fi series that portrays the vastness of space as a backdrop for the personal lives of ordinary people—people who may have been born on Earth, but whose hopes and dreams lie amongst the stars.\r\n[Written by MAL

Upset at not having a male heir, her father decides to raise her as a man and names the girl Oscar.

Iwakura, an awkward and introverted fourteen-year-old, is one of the many girls from her school to receive a disturbing email from her classmate Chisa Yomoda—the very same Chisa who recently committed suicide. Lain has neither the desire nor the experience to handle even basic technology; yet, when the technophobe opens the email, it leads her straight into the Wired, a virtual world of communication networks similar to what we know as the internet. Lain's life is turned upside down as she begins to encounter cryptic mysteries one after another. Strange men called the Men in Black begin to appear wherever she goes, asking her questions and somehow knowing more about her than even she herself knows. With the boundaries between reality and cyberspace rapidly blurring, Lain is plunged into more surreal and bizarre events where identity, consciousness, and perception are concepts that take on new meanings.\r\n\r\nWritten by Chiaki J.

These merciless murderers only leave behind scant remainders of souls called \"Torches,\" which are mere residues that will eventually be destroyed, along with the very fact of the victims' existence from the minds of the living. In an ambitious endeavor to put an end to this invisible, hungry massacre, warriors called Flame Hazes relentlessly fight these monsters.\r\nOne fateful day, Yuuji Sakai ceases to be a regular high schooler—he becomes trapped in a crevice of time and is suddenly attacked by a Denizen. Coming to his rescue just in the nick of time is a nameless hunter who seems no different from an ordinary young girl except for her blazing eyes and burning crimson hair. However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.\r\n[Written by MAL

Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor. \r\n(Source: ANN)","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku TV","en_jp":"Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume (1998)","ja_jp":"万能文化猫娘"},"canonicalTitle":"Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume (1998)","abbreviatedTitles":["Nuku Nuku","Bannou Bunka Nekomusume"],"averageRating":"66.68","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"2","3":"0","4":"3","5":"0","6":"6","7":"0","8":"17","9":"0","10":"24","11":"0","12":"56","13":"1","14":"43","15":"0","16":"26","17":"0","18":"10","19":"0","20":"10"},"userCount":540,"favoritesCount":0,"startDate":"1998-01-07","endDate":"1998-03-25","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":5836,"ratingRank":5757,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/342/tiny.jpg?1408441266","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/342/small.jpg?1408441266","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/342/medium.jpg?1408441266","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/342/large.jpg?1408441266","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/342/original.jpg?1408441266","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":null,"episodeCount":12,"episodeLength":null,"totalLength":23,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/342/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"343","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/343"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:05:38.166Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T15:03:04.009Z","slug":"elfen-lied-special","synopsis":"Having been accepted into the Kaede Inn, Nana struggles to find some way to contribute, though she inadvertently brings more trouble than assistance.

Confused, she is welcomed into this new world as one of the Haibane, a group of youth with small gray wings and bright halos. Together, they live in the Old Home on the outskirts of Grie, a quiet town where wingless, halo-less people live.\r\nThere are many rules governing the world of Haibane Renmei: the most important one being that Haibane cannot go near or touch the massive walls that surround the town. Only beings known as Toga may come and go as they please.\r\nAlthough her daily life is quiet, there is much Rakka and the other Haibane do not know, or are not allowed to know. Rakka will work through her own doubts and questions as she figures out what she is doing in this world, while working towards the goal of each Haibane: to get beyond the walls on their Day of Flight. But this is not a light task: failure means being branded as one who is Sin-bound.","coverImageTopOffset":5,"titles":{"en":"Haibane Renmei","en_jp":"Haibane Renmei","ja_jp":"灰羽連盟"},"canonicalTitle":"Haibane Renmei","abbreviatedTitles":["Charcoal Feather Federation"],"averageRating":"80.3","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"89","3":"2","4":"47","5":"1","6":"29","7":"5","8":"154","9":"5","10":"209","11":"3","12":"583","13":"18","14":"1120","15":"40","16":"1886","17":"54","18":"1484","19":"33","20":"1695"},"userCount":19151,"favoritesCount":689,"startDate":"2002-10-10","endDate":"2002-12-19","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":519,"ratingRank":549,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/354/tiny.jpg?1416717247","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/354/small.jpg?1416717247","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/354/medium.jpg?1416717247","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/354/large.jpg?1416717247","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/354/original.jpg?1416717247","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/354/tiny.jpg?1519179999","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/354/small.jpg?1519179999","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/354/large.jpg?1519179999","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/354/original.jpg?1519179999","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":13,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":312,"youtubeVideoId":"B2yKFMPgXmA","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/354/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"355","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/355"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:05:49.562Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"capeta","synopsis":"Taira Kappeita, or Capeta, was a 4th grader boy.

A seemingly young woman named Yurine and her servant, the Karas (from the Japanese word for \"Crow\"), have long maintained order and balance between the overlapped worlds, ultimately keeping the demons from interrupting the lives of humans. However, humans have come to forget and jest at the existence of demons, and no longer understand the privilege it is to live without fear. Disgusted by this arrogance, an old Karas turns his back on the laws he had once upheld, and in his human form, named Eko, he creates an army of Mikura, or mechanized demons, to ready an attack on the human race.\r\nA young man named Otoha inherits the powers of the Karas and takes his place at the side of Yurine, who claims that his soul called out for her while he lived the life of a human. They live in the world of the demons. It is now up to Otoha to prove himself as a Karas, and restore the balance that Eko threatens to upset.\r\nMeanwhile, a superstitious police officer named Sagisaka and his rational new recruit, Kure, follow the trail of the murders dealt by Eko's Mikura, as well as the trail of a rogue Mikura named Nue.

The story revolves around a group of five magicians who set out to rebuild their world after a rampaging God destroys it and tips it into chaos. Driven by their leader Dark Schneider, Gara, Arshes Nei, Abigail and Kall Su set out to conquer kingdoms in the hope of rebuilding them into utopias, with each of the magicians having their own personal agenda in doing so. However, Dark Schneider's often reckless manner and short temper leads him to wreak havoc where ever he goes. He is trapped by a group of clerics in a baby boy, leaving the four without a leader.\r\nFifteen years later, the four still continue their quest but their motives have changed to despotic world domination, and it is up to Dark Schneider to show them the \"error of their ways,\" when he is freed by the clerics who once imprisoned him, so that he may defend them against his former comrades. It has now become Dark Schneider's responsibility to track down each one of his companions and set them on the right path again, but what seems to be the once reckless and amoral Dark Schneider has changed over his fifteen year imprisonment within the boy, Luche Len Len.\r\n(Source: AniDB)","coverImageTopOffset":200,"titles":{"en":"Bastard!!","en_jp":"Bastard!!: Ankoku no Hakaishin","ja_jp":"バスタード!! 暗黒の破壊神"},"canonicalTitle":"Bastard!!: Ankoku no Hakaishin","abbreviatedTitles":["Bastard!!

The only characteristic he has to go by is that the murderer has a claw for an arm, hence the murderer being referred to as The Claw Man. During his travels, Van happens to pass through the city of Evergreen, which is defending itself from bandits who aim to rob the city of its treasury. It is in this city that Van meets Wendy Garret, a timid young girl who is looking for her kidnapped brother. When the city pleads for Van's assistance to defend it, he refuses, claiming it has nothing to do with him and thus leaves the city on its own to deal with the peril. Soon after, Van comes across the raiding bandits himself and they eventually tick off the swordsman to a degree where he takes action against them for his own personal vendetta. Surprisingly, Van learns that the bandits had ties with The Claw Man, and in kidnapping Wendy's brother for a reason they did not disclose. After the bandits are dealt with easily, Van and, much to his chagrin, Wendy continue the journey in search of The Claw Man. Little do they know, however, that The Claw Man is involved with something more atrocious than either could fathom.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":197,"titles":{"en":"Gun x Sword","en_jp":"Gun x Sword","ja_jp":"ガン×ソード"},"canonicalTitle":"Gun x Sword","abbreviatedTitles":["Gun vs Sword"],"averageRating":"73.11","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"7","3":"0","4":"22","5":"1","6":"34","7":"0","8":"61","9":"0","10":"118","11":"3","12":"336","13":"3","14":"546","15":"9","16":"502","17":"12","18":"170","19":"4","20":"244"},"userCount":5181,"favoritesCount":38,"startDate":"2005-07-04","endDate":"2005-12-26","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":1840,"ratingRank":2405,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/376/tiny.jpg?1408441350","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/376/small.jpg?1408441350","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/376/medium.jpg?1408441350","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/376/large.jpg?1408441350","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/376/original.jpg?1408441350","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/376/tiny.jpg?1519180045","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/376/small.jpg?1519180045","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/376/large.jpg?1519180045","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/376/original.jpg?1519180045","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800}}}},"episodeCount":26,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":624,"youtubeVideoId":"","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/376/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"377","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/377"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:06:11.117Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T15:03:04.854Z","slug":"kore-ga-watashi-no-goshujin-sama","synopsis":"Izumi Sawatari and her younger sister, Mitsuki Sawatari, have run away from home and are in need of employment.

One was Kyoushirou Mibu, a skilled and noble warrior in possession of the unique powers of the Mibu Clan. The other was the thousand-man slayer, with eyes and hair the color of blood, \"Demon Eyes\" Kyou. Their legendary clash was cut short when a meteor from the heavens fell down upon that battlefield, leaving both to vanish in its wake.Samurai Deeper Kyou begins four years after that battle, when a gun-wielding bounty hunter by the name of Yuya Shiina hunts down Kyoushirou—now a perverted, traveling medicine-man who has built up a large debt. On her way to claim his bounty, they are attacked by an inhuman monster that seeks to devour Kyoushirou. This encounter awakens \"Demon Eyes\" Kyou, whose mind has been trapped inside of Kyoushirou's body ever since that fateful battle. Thus begins a grand tale of legendary two swordsmen and the discovery of their secrets.","coverImageTopOffset":0,"titles":{"en":"Samurai Deeper Kyo","en_jp":"Samurai Deeper Kyou","ja_jp":"SAMURAI DEEPER KYO"},"canonicalTitle":"Samurai Deeper Kyou","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"67.52","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"17","3":"0","4":"28","5":"0","6":"41","7":"1","8":"108","9":"1","10":"130","11":"1","12":"240","13":"1","14":"364","15":"3","16":"237","17":"1","18":"91","19":"0","20":"112"},"userCount":3083,"favoritesCount":12,"startDate":"2002-07-02","endDate":"2002-12-23","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":2581,"ratingRank":5279,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/383/tiny.jpg?1458595789","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/383/small.jpg?1458595789","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/383/medium.jpg?1458595789","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/383/large.jpg?1458595789","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/383/original.jpg?1458595789","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":null,"height":null},"small":{"width":null,"height":null},"medium":{"width":null,"height":null},"large":{"width":null,"height":null}}}},"coverImage":null,"episodeCount":26,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":624,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/383/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"384","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/384"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:06:18.512Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-14T12:00:26.019Z","slug":"spriggan","synopsis":"Deep in the Ararat Mountains of Turkey, a secret organization known as ARCAM has found what is believed to be Noah's Ark.
